    "In the following code, we'll use [TA-Lib](https://mrjbq7.github.io/ta-lib/) to create technical indicators as features.\n",

    "We're simply adding all available features from TA-Lib.\n",
    "However, there are some important points to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Considerations for Features\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Avoid Using Future Information\n",
    "\n",
    "Future information cannot be used in live trading.\n",
    "Also, including future information often dramatically improves prediction accuracy,\n",
    "which leads to unrealistic backtesting results.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we use a simple moving average (SMA), we need to be careful about the calculation method.\n",
    "Some implementations calculate the average of n data points centered on the current time,\n",
    "which means they use future data points. We must use only past data points for our calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Handle Missing Values\n",
    "\n",
    "Technical indicators often create missing values (NaN).\n",
    "For example, when calculating a 20-period moving average,\n",
    "the first 19 values will be NaN because there isn't enough historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to handle these missing values appropriately.\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll simply remove rows with missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feature Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "Different features can have vastly different scales.\n",
    "For example, BTC price might be in millions (of JPY),\n",
    "while RSI values range from 0 to 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning algorithms generally perform better when features are on similar scales.\n",
    "Therefore, we'll normalize our features."
